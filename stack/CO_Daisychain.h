 *
 * CANopen Daisychain extension
 *
 * This extension gives CANopen the functionallity of detecting the
 * physical structure of a network by using an additional wire (sequential
 * daisy chain, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisy_chain_(electrical_engineering)).
 *
 * The daisychain event contains the active node ID and the current shift
 * counter. It should be triggered by the Daisy Chain shift input.
 * This message uses the same COB ID on all nodes. The contained node ID
 * indicates the transmitter. It is in the user's responsibility to only
 * trigger the shift event on one node at a time.
 * The used COB ID (0x6DF) is not in the pre-defined connection set and is
 * also not reserved.
 *
 * The following functions are supported
 * - Daisychain event generation
 * - Daisychain event detection
 *
 * For this, the following CAN message is used:
 * COB ID | Byte0          | Byte1
 * 0x6DF  | Event Counter  | own Node DI
